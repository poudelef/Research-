### Introduction

**Problem:** 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is created every day" and "720,000 hours of video are uploaded daily on YouTube.

**Video Summarization** - automatic process of summarizing the video while keeping the key element. Summary of the video can take two forms:
1. **Static video summary (Story Based)**: This is a collection of still images, or key frames, that represent the most important moments of the video
2. **Dynamic video summary (video-skim)**: This is a shorter video composed of sequence of key shots from the original

#### Current Limmitation in teh field
1. Most method work well only on one area (Domain Specific).

This paper talks about using different types of information beyond just video frames such as audio, video, and depth information. Summarization of video using multi-view and multi-modal data, different summary types, and different methodologies. 

### Research Questions
1. What methods are used for video summarization?
2. What characteristics are used to summarize data?
3. What types of multimedia ontent (e.g., 2D, 3D, multi-model) are used as input?
4. How well do existing appraches handle the challenges of different application domains and input data types? 

### Main Goals

1. To analyze how summarization methods and challenges change with advancements in visual data (e.g., from 2D to 3D).
2. To discuss the advantages of using different multimedia attributes (text, audio, depth).
3. To provide details of benchmark datasets.
4. To identify the limitations and gaps in current research.
